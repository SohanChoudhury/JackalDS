  Thanks for stopping by! We’re Rohit and Sohan, Computer Science majors with concentrations in Theory and Intelligence at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We started this blog as outlet to share our data exploration with a wider community.

## Rohit

I grew up in a charming small city in Iowa. In the 7th grade, I left its comfort to the busy yet beautiful Chicago. Soon after I attended the [Illinois Mathematics Science Academy](https://www.imsa.edu) and later the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu).

Here in Atlanta, I decided to pursue a Computer Science major with an Economic minor. In the future, I hope to use my Computer Science skills in Fintech or Bioinformatics. The idea to use data and computation to predict social movement or use biology paired with machine learning to diagnose diseases fascinates me.

Outside of just coursework, I work part-time on Home Depot’s Search Engine team and am the treasurer of the Computational Finance club. I also work with a research team to use genetic programming to understand news headlines and see how they will affect the stock market.

In my free time, I am always down for a pickup game of ultimate frisbee, going on a run, listening to some Chance and of course blogging! You can always talk to me about philosophy, consumer tech, or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

## Sohan

I am originally from suburban Connecticut, and graduated from [Fairfield Warde High School](http://fairfieldschools.org/schools/fwhs/). At Tech, I’ve grown to love the bustle of Atlanta and have delved into the field of Data Science.

Outside of classes, I’m an avid competitor on the Georgia Tech Debate Team and member of the [Data Science Club](http://datasciencegt.org), where my team is creating a predictive model of crime for our campus police department.

As someone relatively new to Computer Science, I hope to explore new technologies and their applications. My primary experience in the field was working in bioinformatics at [Yale](http://sohanchoudhury.com/Yale/), where I developed programs to detect abnormal genetic splicing linked to leukemia. Ever since, I’ve been captivated by computational theory and problem solving.

I enjoy new foods, attending talks, and striking up conversation about watches, politics, [logic problems](https://github.com/SohanChoudhury/APrisonerProblem), and anything in between. Oh, and I also run a fantastic blog with an okay guy.
