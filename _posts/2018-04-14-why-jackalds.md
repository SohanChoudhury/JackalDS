Above we see the golden spiral manifest itself throughout nature in shells, flowers, and more. It grows at a rate equal to the ratio between concurrent Fibonacci terms as they approach infinity. This is evidence that patterns are everywhere, simply waiting to be discovered &mdash; that is what excites us.

We joined CS, intrigued by both the technical challenge as well as the promise of problem solving. While we’ve been exposed to the latter in great capacity, our experiences have been both deterministic and structured.

There’s always a correct answer, mandatory syntax, and an optimal O(N) efficiency. Data science, on the other hand, is based on the premise of why. It exists in a constant state of discovery, seeking not only to answer questions but to pose them.

This is the problem solving that excites us. Answers are seldom defined, and correlation prompts further inquiry. Ultimately, the value lies in asking the *right* questions.

JackalDS is our outlet for exploration. Here, we want to study data, discover trends, and display findings elegantly.  In the coming weeks, you can expect analysis of contemporary datasets, technical walkthroughs, and personal takes on the role of data in our society. We hope you join us on our journey.

As for the name, Jackal? We’ll get back to you on that.
