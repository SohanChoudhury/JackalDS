The golden spiral manifests itself throughout nature in shells, flowers, and the human body. It has been described as pleasing to the human eye, and hailed as an example of how vision has evolved to prefer such patterns.

As put by Adrian Bejan, professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke University,
> It is well known that the eyes take in information more efficiently when they scan side to side… This is the best flowing configuration for images from plane to brain.

And the basis for this spiral? It’s a logarithmic pattern whose growth factor is a simple ratio which we get from the Fibonacci Sequence. The physical structures have entranced us for millennia, but it is only recently that we’ve been able to truly understand and quantify their nature.

It’s evidence that patterns are everywhere, simply waiting to be discovered. That is what excites us.

We joined CS, intrigued by both the technical challenge as well as the promise of problem solving. While we’ve been exposed to the latter in great capacity, our experiences have been both deterministic and structured.

There’s always a correct answer, mandatory syntax, and an optimal O(N). Data science, on the other hand, is based on the premise of why. It exists in a constant state of discovery, seeking not only to answer questions but to pose them.


This is the problem solving that excites us. Answers are seldom defined, and correlation prompts further inquiry. Ultimately, the values lies in asking the *right* questions.

JackalDS is our outlet for exploration. Here, we want to study data, discover trends, and display findings elegantly.  In the coming weeks, you can expect analysis of contemporary phenomena, discussions regarding the role of data in our society, and much more. We hope you join us on journey.
